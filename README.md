# Embedded-System-air-controller
This is my final project for embedded system course.
In this project, I designed an air conditioner and simulated it using the Proteus tool. The system samples temperature and humidity from three points by three temperature and humidity sensors and controls a heater, an air conditioner and a humidifier.
## Controller conditions:
The air conditioner has two operating modes: slow (Low) and fast (High). When the temperature rises above 32 ° C, the air conditioner turns on in Low mode, and if the temperature rises above 38 ° C, High mode is activated for the air conditioner. If the temperature is below 35 ° C, the air conditioner will turn off the High mode and if the temperature is below 28 ° C, the air conditioner will turn off.

The heater has two operating modes: slow (Low) and fast (High). When the temperature is below 20 ° C, the heater turns on in Low mode and if the temperature is below 15 ° C, High mode is activated for the heater. If the temperature is above 17 ° C, the heater will go out of High mode and if the temperature is above 23 ° C, the heater will turn off.

The humidifier has two modes of operation (Low) and high (High). When the humidity is below 80%, the humidifier turns on in Low mode, and if the humidity is below 70%, High mode is activated for the humidifier. If the humidity is higher than 75%, the dehumidifier goes out of High mode and if the humidity is higher than 85%, the humidifier turns off.
